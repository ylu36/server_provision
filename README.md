HW1B
===============

I provisioned two VMs for this homework assignment, one using AWS, and another using DigitalOcean. Screencast is <a href="https://youtu.be/MXzOsKHs_Vw">here</a>.

Automatically provisioning a computational resource will be one of the most important skills for you to master in your career. You have gained experience using digitalocean to automatically create virtual images on a hosted server. As part of any risk management strategy, it is also important to be able to have access to a variety of platforms to avoid vender lock-in and systematic failures.

In this homework assignment, you will complete the following tasks:

Be able to automatically provision using a code api from 2 service providers. Have the code request a new VM and then save or print out the ip address of the new server.
Use configuration management to be able to build your repo, e.g., use package managers such as npm, maven, etc. to declare and manage your software dependencies.
